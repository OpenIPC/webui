### Support

OpenIPC offers two levels of support.

- Free support through the community via [chat][3].
- Paid commercial support directly from the team of developers.

Please consider subscribing for paid commercial support if you intend to use our
product for business. As a paid customer, you will get technical support and
maintenance services directly from our skilled team. Your bug reports and
feature requests will get prioritized attention and expedited solutions. It's a
win-win strategy for both parties, that would contribute to the stability your
business, and help core developers to work on the project full-time.

If you have any specific questions concerning our project, feel free to
[contact us](mailto:dev@openipc.org).

### Participating and Contribution

If you like what we do, and willing to intensify the development, please
consider participating.

You can improve existing code and send us patches. You can add new features
missing from our code.

Remember that you write for embedded linux thus please keep
your code as small and opimized as possible. Avoid using extra libraries like
jQuery, pure JavaScript is quite enough. Use valid HTML5 code. Avoid using
deprecated tags and attributes.

You can help us to write a better documentation, proofread and correct our
websites.

You can just donate some money to cover the cost of development and long-term
maintaining of what we believe is going to be the most stable, flexible, and
open IP Network Camera Framework for users like yourself.

You can make a financial contribution to the project at [Open Collective][4].

Thank you.
